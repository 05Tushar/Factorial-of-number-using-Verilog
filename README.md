1. The calculator takes a 32 bit number as input.
2. The input is unsigned, that is you don’t have to take care of the sign (number can only be positive).
3. Output of the calculator includes a single 32 bit number which will be the result and a single bit output indicating the overflow.
4. Overflow occurs when more than 32 bits are required to represent the result.
