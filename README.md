1. The calculator takes a a n-bit numbers as input.
2. The two inputs unsigned, that is you donâ€™t have to take care of the sign (number can only be
positive).
3. Output of the calculator includes a single 2**(2+N-bit) bit number which will be the result 
4. Overflow can never happen as size of output adjusts accprding to size of input.
