1. The calculator takes two 32 bit numbers as input.
2. The two inputs are unsigned, that is you don’t have to take care of the sign (number can only be
positive).
3. Output of the calculator includes a single 32 bit number which will be the result and a single bit
output indicating the overflow.
4. Overflow occurs when more than 32 bits are required to represent the result.
5. it works fine
