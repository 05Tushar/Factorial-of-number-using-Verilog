1. The calculator takes two 32 bit numbers as input.
2. The two inputs are unsigned, that is you donâ€™t have to take care of the sign (number can only be
positive).
3. Output of the calculator includes a single 32 bit number which will be the result and a single bit
output indicating the overflow.
4. Overflow occurs when more than 32 bits are required to represent the result.
